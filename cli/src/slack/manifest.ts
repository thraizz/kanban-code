export const MANIFEST_INSTRUCTIONS = `To create the Slack app:
  1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps  ->  "Create New App"  ->  "From a manifest"
  2. Pick the workspace, paste the manifest above, create the app.
  3. Under "Basic Information" -> "App-Level Tokens", generate a token with the
     "connections:write" scope. That is your SLACK_APP_TOKEN (xapp-...).
  4. Under "Install App", install to the workspace. Copy the Bot User OAuth Token.
     That is your SLACK_BOT_TOKEN (xoxb-...).
  5. Invite the bot to each agent's private channel, and to any channel you want
     it to read/post in (e.g. #dev):  /invite @langwatch-agents
  6. Map each AGENT channel to an agent in the agents config (slackChannel). Other
     channels the bot is in (like #dev) are readable/writable on demand by agents,
     they are just not relayed into a session.`;
