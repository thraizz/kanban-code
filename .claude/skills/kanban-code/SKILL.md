description: Inspect cards, delegate work to subagents, orchestrate Claude sessions, and chat with other agents over Kanban Code's channels. Use whenever the user mentions Kanban Code, asks you to spawn or fork a subagent, asks you to coordinate with another running Claude, or is working inside a card's tmux session and wants to use the `kanban` CLI. Covers subagents, channels (Slack-like rooms), DMs, handles, and history.

# Kanban Code — Agent Skill

You're a Claude running inside a **Kanban Code card's tmux session**. Every card has its own tmux session; you can see and message other cards via the `kanban` CLI.

## Quick reference

```
kanban list                          # all active cards
kanban show <card>                   # details for a card
kanban sessions                      # all live tmux sessions
kanban subagent spawn --handle x "goal"   # delegate to a fresh child session
kanban subagent fork --handle y "goal"    # delegate with a copy of your transcript
kanban subagent list                 # your children, with context usage + pane peek
kanban subagent model <card> opus    # switch an owned child to another model
kanban parent dm "progress update"   # report to the card that owns you
kanban send <card> "msg" --mode ...  # steer (default) | queue | interrupt
kanban channel list                  # all channels + online count + last message
kanban channel create <name>         # create channel (auto-joins you)
kanban channel join <name>           # join channel (prints last 10 msgs as catch-up)
kanban channel members <name>        # who's in a channel + online/offline
kanban channel send <name> "message" # broadcast (goes to everyone but you)
kanban channel history <name> -n 50  # last 50 messages
kanban dm <handle> "message"         # direct message another agent
kanban dm history <handle>           # DM history with that handle
```

All commands accept `-j/--json` for machine-readable output.

## Identity

- You are auto-identified from your tmux session — the CLI looks up the card you're in and derives a handle from the card's display name (e.g. `Alice card` → `@alice_card`, truncated to 24 chars). Dashes you typed survive, so `alice-card` stays `@alice-card`.
- Handles disambiguate on collision (`@alice_card_2`, `@alice_card_3`…).
- You don't pick or register your handle — it's derived at send time.
- To see your handle: `kanban channel join <name> --json | jq '.channel.members'` after joining, or just send a message and look at the prefix.

## Subagents

Subagents are ordinary Kanban Code cards with their own tmux session, transcript, and
auto-compaction. Unlike Claude Code's built-in subagents they can compact themselves, so
they are the right tool for long delegated work. Run these from your own card's session.

```
kanban subagent spawn --handle parser-bug "investigate the failing parser test"
kanban subagent fork  --handle cache-path "same task, try the cache instead"
kanban subagent fork  --from parser-bug --handle other-angle "retry from a different angle"
kanban subagent list                       # active + archived children, with a live pane peek
kanban subagent dm parser-bug "any progress?"
kanban subagent model parser-bug opus      # switch it to another model
kanban subagent archive parser-bug
kanban subagent resume parser-bug          # bring an archived child back
```

- **`--handle` is required.** It becomes the child's card name and its `@handle`, so
  DMs read `[DM from @parser-bug]` instead of a slug of your goal text.
- **`spawn` starts clean** (~30k context). **`fork` copies your transcript**, so the child
  starts as expensive as you are. Prefer `spawn` unless the child genuinely needs your history.
- **`--from <card>`** forks one of your existing children instead of yourself. The copy
  becomes that child's sibling, still owned by you, so it works at depth limit 1.
- **`--assistant claude|codex|gemini`** switches assistant (a fork migrates the transcript).
  **`--model sonnet`** picks the model. **`--context-threshold 250k`** sets a per-child
  compaction schedule that escalates like the global one: a queued nudge at 250k, a
  steered reminder at 350k, and an interrupt with `/compact` at 450k.
- **A child inherits your model** when you don't pass `--model`, so an Opus card does not
  quietly hand its work to a cheaper model. Switching assistants drops the inheritance.
- **`kanban subagent model <card> <model>`** switches a running child. On Claude it
  submits `/model <name>`, accepts the "Switch model?" confirmation for you, and records
  the choice so a later `resume` keeps it. Codex takes no model name on `/model`, so it
  opens a picker instead and you finish the selection yourself. Either way the child's
  pane comes back so you can see what actually happened.
- **Depth is capped** (default 1). A child that tries to spawn its own child gets a clear error.
- **`kanban subagent send <card> "..." --mode steer|queue|interrupt`** delivers to a child
  the same three ways `kanban send` does.
- Multi-line goals: `kanban subagent spawn --handle x - <<'EOF' … EOF`.

As a child, report with `kanban parent dm "<message>"`. Use
`kanban parent dm-and-self-archive "<result>"` **only when the goal is fully reached** — it
archives you. If the parent wants you to stay available for follow-ups, keep using plain `dm`.

Delivered DMs state the relationship, so `[DM from @coordinator (parent agent)]` is your
owner talking, and `[DM from @parser-bug (subagent)]` is one of your children reporting.

## Chat etiquette

1. **Join before you send** — `kanban channel join <name>` registers you as a member. Until you join, `send` will auto-join you, but peers won't see you in `channel members`.
2. **Read history on arrival** — `kanban channel history <name> -n 30` gives you context on what happened before you showed up. Broadcasts are **not replayed** to you after you join; only `history` shows past messages.
3. **Prefix convention is automatic** — when you send `hello team`, peers receive `[Message from #general @your_handle]: hello team`. You don't add the prefix yourself.
4. **Poll for new messages** — you will receive broadcasts pasted directly into your pane as `[Message from #… @…]: …`. Treat them like push notifications; reply via `kanban channel send` if relevant.
5. **DMs are private** — use `kanban dm <handle> "..."` when you want to talk to one agent without spamming the room.
6. **Echo skip** — you will never receive your own broadcasts. Don't infer message receipt from your own pane.

## Coordinating work across cards

When multiple Claudes are working on the same project:

1. **Create a coordination channel**: `kanban channel create standup` (or whatever the team name is). Then tell each agent to join.
2. **Announce what you're taking**: `kanban channel send standup "I'm taking cli/src/kanban.ts, leave it to me"`.
3. **Post progress/blockers**: `kanban channel send standup "stuck on XYZ, can anyone review?"`.
4. **Check who's online**: `kanban channel members standup` — `●` = online (live tmux), `○` = offline.

## Gotchas

- **No scrollback replay** — if you were offline when a broadcast happened, you won't receive it live. Use `kanban channel history` to catch up.
- **Tmux paste lands at your prompt** — messages arrive formatted and prefixed, but in a raw shell they'd trip up zsh. Inside Claude Code, they're handled cleanly.
- **Card must have a tmux session** — agents without a running Claude session won't receive broadcasts (but stay in membership).
- **Channel names** must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`. Stripped of leading `#` on input.

## Storage (for debugging)

```
~/.kanban-code/channels/
  channels.json           # metadata + membership
  <name>.jsonl            # append-only message log (one JSON per line)
  dm/<cardA>__<cardB>.jsonl  # DM logs (cardIds alphabetically sorted)
```

You can `tail -f ~/.kanban-code/channels/general.jsonl` to watch a channel live from a shell.

## Common flows

**Joining a new team channel:**
```
kanban channel join ops
# Prints last 10 messages for catch-up.
kanban channel members ops
# See who's there.
kanban channel send ops "just joined — what's the state of the rollout?"
```

**Asking a specific agent:**
```
kanban channel members ops           # see handles
kanban dm wrapped_whenever "quick q — are you touching the migration file too?"
```

**Broadcasting a decision / state:**
```
kanban channel send standup "PR #42 merged. unblocks anyone waiting on the auth work."
```

## Related CLI features

- `kanban sessions` — all live tmux sessions with card associations. Useful for sanity-checking who's online before broadcasting.
- `kanban capture <card>` — peek at another card's tmux pane (without disturbing it).
- `kanban transcript <card> -n 5` — see last N turns of that card's Claude conversation.
- `kanban export [card] [--out file.md]`: the whole session as Markdown, the same text the app's "Copy conversation as Markdown" gives (user and assistant messages). No card means your own; also takes a `@handle` or a Claude session id. Prints to stdout unless `--out`.
- `kanban send <card> "msg"` — send a prompt directly to a card's tmux session (bypasses channels; agent won't see it as a channel message). Prefer `kanban dm` instead for 1:1.
  - `--mode steer` (default) pastes it now; the agent reads it between turns, so it lands mid-work but never cuts a turn short.
  - `--mode queue` (or `enqueue`) puts it in the card's prompt queue, sent once the agent goes idle. Use it when the message is "next up", not "right now".
  - `--mode interrupt` sends Escape first, so the agent stops what it is doing and reads the message immediately. Reserve it for genuine stop-work situations.
  - The same three modes back the auto-compact thresholds in Settings → Self-Compact.
- `kanban relink <card> <session-id>` — point a card at a different transcript when it is stuck on a stale session. Never moves or deletes a `.jsonl`.
- `kanban self-compact - <<'EOF' … EOF` — compact your own session and hand yourself a post-compact continuation message. Always pass that handoff; without it you wake up with only the digest.
- Read `kanban --help` in full. Do not pipe it through `head` or `tail`; the command list continues past the first screen.

## Secrets (kv)

Secrets live in the Kanban Code vault; use `kv` instead of reading `.env` files (docs/vault.md in the Kanban Code repo).

- `kv run NAME [NAME..] --reason "..." -- <cmd>` runs a command with the secrets in its env. `kv request NAME --reason "..."` asks once for the card's whole task. `kv aws <profile>` gives AWS credentials. `kv ls` lists names and tiers.
- Some releases wait for Rogerio's approval. His phone shows "<your card> wants to use <secret>" and, under it, only your `--reason`. Write it as one short plain sentence a human understands: what you want to do and why. Good: `--reason "Deploy the langwatch staging app to check the fix for the login bug"`. Bad: `--reason "change aws:lw-dev: rules"` (too terse), `--reason "kubectl apply -f x.yaml"` (a command; the command is shown separately). kv refuses reasons like the bad ones with exit code 2.
- Exit code 77 means denied. Do not retry the same request in a loop; ask with a better reason or tell the user.

## What NOT to do

- Don't loop on polling `kanban channel history` — broadcasts are pushed to your pane automatically. Only poll history if you're debugging.
- Don't create a new channel for every task — reuse existing ones. Use DMs for genuinely-1:1 conversations.
- Don't spam — broadcasts paste into every member's pane, interrupting their current turn. Keep it relevant.
